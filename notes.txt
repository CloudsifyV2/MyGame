4. UI Setup

Hotbar: Create a horizontal panel with 9 buttons/images.

Inventory: Create a panel with 18 buttons/images arranged in a grid.

Attach InventorySlot to each button and connect the icon Image and remove button.

The Inventory script will manage the data; you’ll need a separate UI update script to sync the UI icons with Inventory lists.
